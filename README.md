and records the results.
     - Writes successful results to a file (`account_info.txt`) to keep track of progress and avoid losing data if the script is interrupted.
     - Prints progress every 10 IDs to provide feedback on the scriptâ€™s progress.
     - Introduces a small delay (`time.sleep(0.001)`) between requests to prevent rate limiting or overloading the server.
   - **Final Output**:
     - Prints all collected results after processing.

### Usage

To run the script, ensure you have the necessary dependencies (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `lxml` for parsing). Install these using:

```sh
pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml selenium webdriver-manager chrome-driver
```

```sh
ls5 --url https://example.com

### Important Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Adjust the `time.sleep(0.001)` as necessary to avoid hitting rate limits imposed by the website. This delay might need to be increased based on the websiteâ€™s policies.

2. **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling but might need additional checks or refinements based on specific website responses or errors.

3. **Legality and Ethics**: Ensure that you have permission to perform this kind of access check and data extraction, as scraping and automated data collection can violate terms of service or legal regulations. Use responsibly and ethically.

4. **HTML Parsing**: Adjust the BeautifulSoup selectors based on the actual HTML structure of the target website. The `span` tag with class `username` and the email regex are placeholders and may need modification based on real content.

5. **QUIC3**: Works on most quic3 protocols
